Chapter One

Founded in 1995 and has no relation to the Java language

Ecmascript === Javascript && Javascript === ECMAscript

Javascript was introduced in 1995 with Netscape Navigator as a way to add programs to web pages.

Javascript is used in more than just web browsers, it is currently being used as a scripting language and querying language for databases and as an intermediary as well.
     - i.e. Node, MongoDB, CouchDB, etc.

Values Types and Operators

"Inside the computer's world, there is only data."

Any piece of discrete information can be reduced to a sequence of zeros and ones and thus represented in bits.

Binary 00001101, or 8+4+1, which equals 13.

There are six different types of values in JS: numbers, strings, Booleans, objects, functions, and undefined values.

--- To create a value, all that must occur is that you invoke it's name.

--- Javascript uses a fixed number of bits, naely 64 of them to store a single number value.

--- Within JS you can represent 2^64 different numbers, wihc is about 18 quintillion,

 (18,000,000,000,000,000,000)

+ and *, - and /,  symbols are called operators

When operators appera together without parentheses, the order which they are applied is determined by the precdence of the operators.

% is one arithmetic operator that is not typical. It is used to represent the remainder operation.
----314 % 100 produces 14.
---------- This is often referred to as the modulo

----------------------->>> MODULO!! :D

------SPECIAL NUMBERS

--- Infinity and -Infinity  which represent the positive and negative infinities.
------ THIS IS NOT MATHEMATICALLY SOLID

NaN stands for "Not a Number"

when a \ is contained within a string it is actually telling the code that it is escaping that string, and the next character will have a special meaning.

--- if an n follows the back slash then that is indicating a new line.

--- Strings cannot be divided, multiplied, or subtracted but the + operator works to concatenate.

Not all operators are symbols, but some can be written out as words. Such as typeof
--- this produces a string value naming the type of the value you give it.
---operators that take two values are called binary operators. while operators like typeof are considered unary operators since they only take one value.

Booleans are only two options
Yes or No
True or False
On or Off
- use comparisons to produce booleans

The only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself is NaN(Not a Number)

The || operator is technically equivalent to "or"
 --- if both are true than the operation runs.
