Ecmascript === Javascript && Javascript === ECMAscript

Javascript was introduced in 1995 with Netscape Navigator as a way to add programs to web pages.

Javascript is used in more than just web browsers, it is currently being used as a scripting language and querying language for databases and as an intermediary as well.
     - i.e. Node, MongoDB, CouchDB, etc.

Values Types and Operators

"Inside the computer's world, there is only data."

Any piece of discrete information can be reduced to a sequence of zeros and ones and thus represented in bits.

Binary 00001101, or 8+4+1, which equals 13.

There are six different types of values in JS: numbers, strings, Booleans, objects, functions, and undefined values.

--- To create a value, all that must occur is that you invoke it's name.

--- Javascript uses a fixed number of bits, naely 64 of them to store a single number value.

--- Within JS you can represent 2^64 different numbers, wihc is about 18 quintillion,

 (18,000,000,000,000,000,000)

+ and *, - and /,  symbols are called operators

When operators appera together without parentheses, the order which they are applied is determined by the precdence of the operators.

% is one arithmetic operator that is not typical. It is used to represent the remainder operation.
----314 % 100 produces 14.
---------- This is often referred to as the modulo

----------------------->>> MODULO!! :D

------SPECIAL NUMBERS

--- Infinity and -Infinity  which represent the positive and negative infinities.
------ THIS IS NOT MATHEMATICALLY SOLID

NaN stands for "Not a Number"
